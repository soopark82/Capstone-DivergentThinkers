              Grandmothers Against Gun Violence is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2013 a few 
              weeks after the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, with 
              a vision to eliminate gun violence in America. They are a group of 1200 united in their goal to 
              create a safer world for all grandchildren and raising generations. They are committed to diversity 
              and inclusiveness and acknowledge the intergenerational nature of the gun violence prevention movement.

        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p className="content-p"> 
        Gun violence is a prevalent overarching topic that continues to persevere in many communities. 
        We are creating a platform for understanding and mitigating gun violence through data, to illustrate how every family can help keep everyone safe from gun violence. 
        This project is vital because overall, gun violence in the US is on the rise. In 2019 alone, a minor was killed with a gun every 2 hours and 36 minutes. 
        Information inaccessibility is one leading cause of gun violence, which is what we, in coordination with Grandmothers Against Gun Violence Foundation, are aiming to solve.
